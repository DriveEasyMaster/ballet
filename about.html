							<p>One tutu takes about 90 hours to make – that’s almost 4 days!</p>
<p>Tutus can cost up to $3,000 to make!</p>
<p>The first ballet dancers were all men!</p>
<p>Pointe shoes are made by hand!</p>
<p>Ballerinas can wear out 2-3 pairs of ballet shoes per week!</p>
<p>Ballet used to be performed with operas.</p>
<p>A male ballerina is called a “danseur” but in Italy are called “ballerino”.</p>
<p>Male ballerinas lift about 1 and a half tons over the span of a performance!</p>
<p>Dancers rub resin on their shoes to prevent slipping – string players use this too!</p>
<p>Ballet began in France in 1661.</p>
<p>A ballerina can carry 3 times her body weight on the tip of her big toe!</p>
<p>The very first prima ballerina was bestowed upon Pierina Legnani.</p>
<p>Lots of ballerinas used to be royalty!</p>
<p>Ballerinas are just as strong as football players!</p>
<p>Speaking of football players, some of them even take ballet to help them on the field!</p>
<p>The ballerina buns require a combined 400 hours of styling before the performance!</p>
<p>Ballet spread from Italy to France when it began, but it is very popular in Russia!</p>

<p>Early styles of ballet include Russian, French, and Italian ballet!</p>
<p>The most famous style of ballet is Romantic – which is still practiced today!</p>
<p>Ballet means “to dance, or jump about”!</p>
<p>Ballet was always performed for celebrations – sometimes even weddings!</p>
<p>The ballerina’s costumes are the most important part of the dance!</p>
<p>Ballet changed when a dancer shortened her tutu above her ankles – making footwork much more important!</p>
<p>Women weren’t allowed to dance in public until 1681, so they couldn’t join the ballet!</p>
<p>Pointe shoes have to be broken in before they can be danced in!</p>
<p>Pointe shoes can even sound really noisy before they’re broken in, making the ballerina’s steps super loud!</p>
<p>Costumes for the ballet used to be weighted down on purpose – not light or airy!</p>
<p>The most widely recognized or most famous ballet is The Nutcracker by Tchaikovsky!</p>
