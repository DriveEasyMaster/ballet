The ballerina’s costumes are the most important part of the dance!
Ballet changed when a dancer shortened her tutu above her ankles – making footwork much more important!
Women weren’t allowed to dance in public until 1681, so they couldn’t join the ballet!
Pointe shoes have to be broken in before they can be danced in!
Pointe shoes can even sound really noisy before they’re broken in, making the ballerina’s steps super loud!
Costumes for the ballet used to be weighted down on purpose – not light or airy!
